      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;not-ai-mouse-in-a-maze&#34;&gt;Not AI mouse in a maze&lt;/a&gt; project was very successful at getting the virtual mouse to navigate a randomly generated maze using a fairly simple set of rules. It could solve about 99% of them. However, there were some maze designs that it got stuck on and others where it was very slow to find the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, finally it was time to see how well my mouse could do at solving the maze using AI (the &lt;a href=&#34;https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34;&gt;NEAT algorithm&lt;/a&gt;). A brief description of the code, how it works, and a video of the mouse is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mikebarram/AI-Mouse-In-A-Maze/&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
